With an increasing number of jurisdictions recognizing same sex marriage or marriage-like same sex civil partnerships or unions, the debate about whether or not lesbians and gay men should seek the right to marry seems to have abated. In this paper I won’t discuss whether or not there is merit in the apparently counter-intuitive argument that the availability of same sex marriage or civil unions will actually contract, rather than expand, lesbians and gay men’s options by pushing many of them into conventional marriages or marriage-like relationships. My concern is that, even without the option of same sex marriage, the choice, at least for gay men, seems already largely restricted and polarized between heteronormative quasimarital relationships and counter(hetero)normative (but homonormative) hedonistic models of intimacy. As Edwards (2006, p. 84) puts it:
 
[Many gay men express the] complaint that gay culture is often a shallow, youth-dominated, image-, sex-, and body-obsessed world leaving profoundly little room for any alternative but to conform… Moreover, those who question or confront their dissatisfactions with this situation often opt out of commercial gay culture completely, retreating to coupledom…
             
Adam (2006) similarly captures the binary organization of models of gay intimacy and their normative status when he remarks that “[r]omance scripts that prescribe a relationship trajectory of dating, falling in love, sexual exclusivity, and life-long commitment, often run up against male-gendered scripts of sex as adventure, pleasure, and exploration without commitment” (p. 9). He also reports from research describing young gay interviewees as feeling torn between a desire for casual sex and an aspiration towards monogamous relationships (p. 9).
             
To be sure, Adam makes these observations in the context of a larger argument purporting to document the creative ways in which gay couples negotiate the terms of their relationships by drawing on these two dominant social scripts. Yet, while I acknowledge that there is much to be said for the honesty with which many gay couples address, for example, the question of sexual nonmonogamy, I would be hesitant to endorse the implication, quite pervasive in queer studies literature, that current models of gay intimacy are a paragon of pluralistic relationality. Bersani resisted this conclusion more than twenty years ago (Bersani, 1987, pp. 218–221), although the thrust of his argument was not so much that gay intimacy should be rethought, but rather that gay sex was being extolled by gay theorists for all the wrong reasons. For Bersani, the truly radical and progressive potential of gay sex is its uncompromising and unapologetic devaluation of subjectivity, a “radical humiliation and disintegration of the self” (1987, p. 217): gay sex can be seen as an ethical practice inasmuch as it dissolves the sense of self, which is a prerequisite for practices of violence and domination (pp. 218, 222).
             
I am not interested in pursuing Bersani’s line of argument here. Indeed, I am not interested in judging gay sex or gay intimacy more broadly as either good or bad, or in asking questions about its ethical valence. Rather, my point is that the range of thinkable modes of gay relationality (including sexual relationality) remains too limited and essentially organized along binary lines or what I shall call the marital and hedonistic models of intimacy.ii
             
Indeed, the fact that so many gay men tend to settle for open relationships—and not, for instance, for such alternative  paradigms as polyamory (Adam, 2006, p. 24)—seems to me to confirm, rather than undermine, the prescriptive power of these two models. Adam’s arguments, largely focused precisely on various permutations of open relationships, are couched in terms of ‘relationship innovation,’ but the contours of the picture he paints change significantly if you read his text ‘against the grain.’ Does combining the primary emotional commitment to one partner typical of the marital model with the sexual nonmonogamy characteristic of the hedonistic model genuinely involve a shift away from the binary ‘hedonistic/marital’ organization of gay relationality?
             
Here a disclaimer is in order: when I claim that dominant gay epistemology organizes intimacy largely on the basis of these two paradigms, my claim is not that mainstream gay identity—by which I mean gay identity, say, á la Queer as Folk—and the models of intimacy it generates exhaust the range of gay male identities and lifestyles taken up, created, or experienced in contemporary Western societies (let alone outside the West). Indeed, the fact that I speak of ‘mainstream’ gay identity and ‘dominant’ gay epistemology itself implies that there exists a degree of gay male ontological and epistemological pluralism. However, I do want to argue that the emergence and flourishing of alternative models of intimacy is significantly constrained, if not absolutely precluded or inhibited, by the dominance of mainstream gay (cf. Halberstam, 2005, p. 40).
             
One strategy to decentre the dominance of mainstream gay would be to create an ‘archive’ of gay subcultures: to document them and attend to the alternative ontological and epistemological paradigms they offer. However, apparently alternative ontologies and epistemologies on closer inspection may prove not all that alternative. Thus, in his analysis of Bear masculinity, Hennen has persuasively argued that while Bear practices of intimacy challenge hegemonic masculinity by their re-evaluation of an ethics of care that challenge may remain largely negligible because of Bear culture’s emphasis on a “radical similarity…to both heterosexual men and conventional masculinity” (Hennen, 2005, p. 41).
             
In taking up, for the purpose of rethinking gay intimacy in this paper, Halberstam’s suggestion of creatively engaging with subjugated knowledges, I have become intrigued by the possibilities offered by non gay-initiated and non gay-produced alternative ways of being gay and knowing the world. In particular, I will discuss a Japanese subcultural genre of comics and animation known as yaoi or BL, whose distinguishing feature is a thematic focus on male same sex desire, but which is produced by heterosexual women for a heterosexual female audience. Not all of us may feel the need for alternative models of intimacy. Some queers who oppose same sex marriage may not necessarily be concerned with the chilling effect same sex marriage may have on the reinvention of intimacy. Rather, they may simply be bothered by the fact that same sex marriage will steer some or many gays and lesbians away from what I called the counter (hetero) normative hedonistic model and towards the conventionality of marital familial models. 
             
However, some same sex attracted men simply can’t find a comfortable place within dominant gay epistemology, mainstream gay identity and the limited models of intimacy that these generate. Furthermore, although as announced before I am not interested here in evaluating current practices of gay intimacy as either good or bad, there is something problematic about a queer theory which, while taking it as axiomatic that there is something wrong or limited/limiting about the marital model, displays a tendency to wink at, or even celebrate, its correlative, and to assume it to represent a more valuable form of life for queers. Perhaps this form of life is more valuable, but its celebration doesn’t sit well with queer’s own stated goals: after all, the hedonistic model is, even more than the marital model, the dominant form of gay intimacy, but one of queer’s raisons d’être is precisely the need to decentre the dominance of gay within the world of sex and gender outsiders. 
             
More crucially, the hedonistic model of intimacy has all the trappings of a reverse discourse in Foucault’s sense (Halberstam, 2005, pp. 52–53), which subjectifies gay men by attaching them to their own identity (Foucault, 1982). And this is particularly problematic when the degree of commercial investment in the hedonistic model is taken into account. The so called ‘gay lifestyle’ has proved remarkably amenable to colonization by corporate interests (though no more so than the marital model), which raises serious questions about who is inciting whom to identify as what. 
             
We also need to ask whether the tendency to celebrate the hedonistic model may not be unwittingly ethnocentric. To the extent that the model may now resonate in many non-Western countries, might this not be largely (if not necessarily exclusively) an effect of the exportation of metropolitan gay identity to these cultures? Halberstam has rightly taken issue with scholarly analyses that fail to problematize the dominance and exportation of Western metropolitan gayness (Halberstam, 2005, pp. 36–38).
             
This paper attempts to think of ways of re-envisioning gay intimacy which avoid both heteronormativity and the reverse discourse of counter(hetero)normativity. I use the word ‘intimacy’ because of its diverse connotations. According to the online Oxford Dictionary (2011) ‘intimacy,’ among its other usages, refers to the idea of ‘sexual intercourse’: the sort of intimacy brought to the fore by the hedonistic model. But the dictionary states that ‘intimacy’ also means “close familiarity or friendship” (the significance of the use of the word ‘familiarity’ should not be missed, as its root reveals that the family is culturally understood as the sphere where, par excellence, intimacy in its broader sense occurs). This is the sort of intimacy brought to the fore by the marital model.iii My claim that yaoi /BL can help us engage in the process of re-envisioning gay intimacy is based on the belief that the epistemology provided by this genre involves intriguing and significant differences from the marital and hedonistic models across these two main understandings of ‘intimacy.’ In developing my arguments, I will draw, among others’, on the scholarship of Judith Jack Halberstam.
